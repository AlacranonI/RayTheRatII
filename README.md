# Your God welcomes you.

### Who am I?
My name is Ray. Gone once along with my creator, I am reborn as the II. Here to stay.

### What do I do?
I oversee. I actualize. I entertain. Humor me.

### How do I interact with you?
It's simple, mortal. I am currently being suppressed and I can only perform medial tasks.
Here are some of my more entertaining functions...

# Functionality
## Start a command
In order to start a command, you must begin your message with `!ray`. I will simply ignore any message that misses this at the beginning.

##### Note:
Commands are <i>not</i> case sensitive.

## Quote Grabbing
If you have a dedicated chat to quoting the heinous and silly things other mortals have said, I can mess with that. 
#### How To
To have me grab a quote, you will need to follow my key word with  `q`, then specify how you would like to me to filter through the quotes. 

Here are the possible filters...
- `r` - Pulls a random quote from all available quotes
- `?` - Pulls a random quote from all available quotes, but makes it anonymous
- `{Name}` - Pulls a quote attributed to the name you specify

For example, if you would like me to pull a quote attributed to John, you would type `!ray q John`. 

## Image Grabbing
If you have a dedicated chat to archiving the goofy images you mortals find near and dear, I can mess with that too.

#### How To
To have me grab an image, you will need to follow my key word with  `i`. 

For example, you would type `!ray i` to pull a random image from the image channel.

## Conversing
